# Simple Markov chains in Haskell

Create Markov Chains from text files using Haskell.

## USE

Compile and run:

```
./Haskov [mytextdoc.txt]
```

## To Do:
    1. Write and store matrices to byte files
    2. Add more intelligent/robust rules
    3. Add additional functions and features
    4. Generalize for all text and non-text based Markov Chains
